  </p>

# Introduction

This is my first videogame made with Unity for a mobile platform (Android). In order to implement this game i have got intermediate physics concepts, triggers and
collisions in 2D and 3D, design and editing of prefabs, creation of animations and graphical interfaces, sounds and scriptable objects.

&nbsp;

# Goal

The aim of the game is to stack as many boxes as possible in order to reach a high score, taking advantage of all the free space you have and taking into account that
the gravity force acts against you.

&nbsp;

# Tools

In order to develop this game, the software tools used are the following ones:

* Unity Hub 2.4.2.
* Unity 3D (version 2019.4.17f1.
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
* Asset Store of Unity (sprites, animations, sounds and backgrounds).
